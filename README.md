# simple-weather-app

Simple Weather App created using React, MUI to search for a city's weather. It has a Search Bar that sends GET requests to City API from API Ninjas to suggest possible city options in the drop-down, then takes the lat/lon data from selected city to make a GET request to Weather API (OpenWeather). Takes last city searched and stores into LocalStorage in order to get data for the city automatically on next visit.
